## Searching algorithms

### Linear search
Checking every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.
Big O: best case is O(1) and the worst or average case is O(n)

### Binary search
Binary search is much faster form of search.
It works only with **SORTED** arrays!
Big O: best case O(1) the worst or average O(log n)
