## Sorting algorithms

### Bubble sort
A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top.
Bubble sort is probably good candidate when you are sorting nearly sorted array.
Big O: best case is O(n) and the worst or average case is O(n^2).

### Selection sort
Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position. This algorithm selects the first element from the unsorted part of the array as minimum value, then it finds the smallest element (from the unsorted part of the array). The smallest element replaced with the first minimum element. Compared to bubble sort, selection sort does less swaps.
